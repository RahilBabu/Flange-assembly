# Flange-assembly
This repository contains a 3D flange assembly modeled using CATIA V5 along with its corresponding 2D technical drawing. The design demonstrates proper assembly constraints, part modeling, and 2D drawing extraction for manufacturing or documentation purposes
The flange assembly consists of multiple parts accurately modeled and constrained to reflect real-world fit and function. The 2D drawing includes standard views, section views, and GD&T annotations to aid in manufacturing and inspection.

Tools Used
CATIA V5 (Part Design, Assembly Design, Drafting Workbenches)
GD&T principles for accurate documentation

 Applications
This design can serve as a reference for:
Mechanical design projects
CAD modeling and drafting practice
Technical documentation and drawing standards
